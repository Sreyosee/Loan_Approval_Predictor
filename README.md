# ðŸ’³ Loan Approval Predictor

A machine learning web app that predicts whether a **loan application** will be approved based on applicant details.  
Built with **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, this app demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow â€” from training and model evaluation to interactive web deployment.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project trains and deploys a binary classification model using the **Loan Approval Prediction Dataset** (from Kaggle).  
The model predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant and loan features.

**Key steps include:**
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Addressing class imbalance using **SMOTE**  
- Training and evaluating models (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree)  
- Selecting the best model based on F1-score  
- Saving the trained pipeline using `joblib`  
- Building an interactive **Streamlit** interface for predictions
